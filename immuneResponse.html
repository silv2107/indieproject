                <h2 style="text-align:center;">The progression of a virus infection in cells</h2>
                <p>The virus particles enter the healthy cell and replicates inside. Eventually the cell is killed by the virus and the new virus particles invade new cells. Tissue damage occurs when virus kill enough cells, which could result in death of the host (animal or human).</p>

                <h2  style="text-align:center;">Killer cells destroys cells infected with virus</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Cells infected with virus display surface changes which are detected by killer cells. Killer cells are the first line of defence against viruses. Killer cells contains the virus from spreading by killing infected cells. Killer cells also create inflammation which is very damaging for the host and therefore killer cells need to be strictly regulated. The animation depicts the killer cells (blue color) interacting with infected cells, thereby killing them after the interaction.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">Regulatory cells inhibit killer cells and produce y-shape antibodies against virus particles.</h2>
                <p>Regulatory cells (green color) emit anitibodies (Y-shape) and stops the inflammation and actions of the killer cells (blue cells). Regulatory cells are the adaptive fase of immunity. They ensure that the virus cannot enter the healthy cells by targeting the virus particle with specific antibodies (Y-shape). The production of antibodies is generally called being immune to a specific virus and immune to sickness produced by that virus.</p>
