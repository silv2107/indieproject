Assignment

The webpage is imformative and should explain the health effects of different types of physical exercises (moderate or intensive exercise) during a virus lung infection. 
Firstly, the site should define moderate and intensive exercise forms. Secondly, it should clarify the regular immune response at a cellular level. Thirdly, it should explain the effects of the different 
types of exercise on the immune response with a conclusion regarding the exercise type for optimal immune response.  

The Design

The main idea for the design is to give the reader concise info about the topic, Exercise and the Immune System. Therefore the reader will see multiple pages to avoid long-drawn pages 
with to much information and to many features. Icons, diagrams and animation are used to avoid descriptive writing. The sections of the webpages are divided in topic-related pages 
so that the reader can learn in a structured, fast and fun way. The content is not explained in to many details for a scientific audience, but rather for an audience with a limited
knowledge about the topic. 
All of the pages have a header and a main, which are further divided en sections. All of the pages are responsive (mobile and desktop). The header remains the same on all pages. 
The header consists of a collabsable burger-box (javascript is used) and a title (clickable from all pages). When the burger-box is clicked it will unfold vertically downwards a 
menu-bar of the different pages. The user can navigate to the different pages. The colorscheme is evident when the menu-bar unfolds. The first page of the website is intented to 
reveal the topic by showing an image-slider of different types of physical types of exercise. The image-slider code is done using javascipt and css. The layout is grid. The 
background image represents some sort of organims. The images are all collected from www.unsplash.com.
Moderate and intense exercise page has a main tag with icon and description that defines the difference between moderate and intensive exercise. Icons are svg format and 
collected from Sune's webpage www.bqardi.dk. Grid layout.
The immune response page contains six elements and comprises three animations using only css. Description of the main phases of the immune response. Grid layout and responsive.
The Exercise and viral infection page has two graphs, which were made using javascript Chart.js. Flex and grid layout. 

Layout usage: mostly grid, but sometimes also flex 

Colorscheme: 

#B5B4D9,#D9CEAD,rgb(191, 65, 65),#D9CEAD, #B5B4D9
